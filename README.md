# Super-resolution

This repo will have super-resolution implementations.

## Deep Back-Projection Networks

A PyTorch implementation of the [Deep Back-Projection Networks For Super-Resolution](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/iim/members/muhammad.haris/projects/DBPN.html) paper (CVPR'18). This code is incomplete at the moment.


Note: Authors of the paper provide the original PyTorch implementation: https://github.com/alterzero/DBPN-Pytorch
along with the Caffe implementation: https://github.com/alterzero/DBPN-caffe and pre-trained models.
